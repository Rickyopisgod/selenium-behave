Getting Start with CrossBrowserTesting and Behave

Behavioural Driven Development is growing in popularity, and performing BDD with Python is no exception. Behave is a popular BDD framework for performing tests, and, because Behave is built on Python's Selenium language bindings, performing Behavioural Driven testing on CBT is easy. We'll walk your through getting started here.

To get started, we'll need to ensure that Behave is installed. The easiest means of doing so is with Pip:

```
pip install Behave
```

Alternatively you can read installation documenation on the Behave website. Once that's complete, we're ready to start writing our first test with Behave.
